.emacs.d
========

My .emacs.d folder. Feel free to take anything you like.

### Initial setup 

After emacs is installed, clone this repository into your home folder:

```git clone https://github.com/ponpal/.emacs.d.git```

I use [cask][cask] for managing packages. To install it, follow [these instructions][cask-installation].

To install the packages listed in the Cask file, all you have to do is issue the following command inside .emacs.d:

```cask install```

### Precautions

If you've already started to customize emacs on your own, cloning my repository into your home folder might not be a good idea. In that case, I suggest you take a look at the [cask project][cask] and peek around in my init.el file.
